## Problem Statement
Ship or vessel detection has a wide range of applications, in the areas of maritime safety,  fisheries management, marine pollution, defence and maritime security, protection from piracy, illegal migration, etc.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.

There are 5 classes of ships to be detected which are as follows:

## Dataset Description
There are 6252 images in train and 2680 images in test data. The categories of ships and their corresponding codes in the dataset are as follows -

There are three files provided to you, viz train.zip, test.csv and sample_submission.csv which have the following structure.

train.zip contains the images corresponding to both train and test set along with the true labels for train set images in train.csv

## Evaluation Metric
The Evaluation metric for this competition is weighted F1 Score.

## Public and Private Split
Public leaderboard is based on randomly selected 30% of the test images, while private leaderboard will be evaluated on remaining 70% of the test images.
